Part 20 post mortem:
What a mess

reduceRight starts from end of array (Desc order)
Binary comparison was very fast (10x faster! than other solution 180ms vs 18ms)
Square should have been configured clockwise to save on debugging time when comparing (ie read the right edge top to bottom, left edge bottom to top)
Edge collection was a good idea and made part1 ez

I did a jank version of BFS, refine next time
